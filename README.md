### Hi there 👋

I am a quantitative researcher/data scientist and social scientist with expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and experimentation.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an application of Large Language Models
- 🌱 I’m currently reading 'Designing Machine Learning Systems' by Chip Hueyn
- 🎓 I've taught grad courses on [Multilevel/Hierarchical Modeling](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Teaching-MultilevelModeling), [Generalized Linear Modeling](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Generalized-Linear-Models), and [Math for Social Sciences](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Math-For-SocialScience)
